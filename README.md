## Installation
No extra libraries needs to run this code. This code runs with no issues using Python using google collab in jupyter notebook. Basic Python data analysis and visualization library required for the analysis. 

## Project Motivation 
This project focused on understanding the data collected through Online Food App Zomato.  
Following are the interested things to understand data better: 

Primay Goal: Zomato is online food delivery app across the world. Here In this data analysis task I would like to find the following Information.

Total Country Contribution in Online Order
  1. Find out the ratings given by the user
  2. Findout which country provides online delivery or not?
  3. Find out which city has given higest order on Zomato
  4. Find out which cuisine is most popular
  
Data Analysis: Do the exploratory Data Analysis
  1. Missing Values 
  2. Explore Numerical Variable
  3. Explore Categorical Variable 
  4. Relation Between features 

Data Visualization: Seaborn and matplotlib are used for data visualization

Throughout this project I have followed CRISP-DM process to get insight from the data and use visualization with the help of graph 
wheneve it is necessary.

## File Descriptions 
The Jyputer Notebook and related data set used in this project is included. 

## Results
The findings of the code can be found at the post available on the Jupyter Note Book.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
